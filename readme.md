Adapt Laerdal Logger
====================

A small adapt plugin to customize logging from courses to a rest api.

Currently course start/end, page hits and media events are logged.

The plugin also exposes a global function to enable custom logging
from e.g. onchange on inputs.

Not very useful for anyone else than Laerdal...
